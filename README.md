# Tetris BOT!!!!

You know what this is; made for the PUMA arm with love

### the game

In the game directory there is a single python file that relies on [PyGame](http://pygame.org).  On Windows and Mac this can be installed from the website, and on ubuntu via "apt-get install python-pygame"

When run it allows you to play the game, and also outputs to the command line commands for the Puma, like in the [example log file](example_game_log.txt)
